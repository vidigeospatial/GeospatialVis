  <abstract>For a complete discussion of Demand Units, please refer to Chapter 3 of the CalSim 3.0 documentation. 

Demand Units are used by CalSim 3.0 to represent water demands and water use in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. Demand units are the smallest computational units within CalSim 3.0; the model does not distinguish between individual water users within a demand unit. Water Budget Areas (WBA) in the Sacramento Valley were developed from a combination of water district boundaries (best available) and watershed boundaries (CalWater2.2/NRCS NHD) and/or demand aggregate unit (DAU-DWR) boundaries. Demand Units were a further breakdown of WBAs based on water district and/or refuge boundaries.
